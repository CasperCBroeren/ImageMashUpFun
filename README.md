# ImageMashUpFun
Fun with F# and images. So I like F# because it's a dotNet but with a new paradigm of functional programming. Which I'm new to. So this repo is a playground of testing and working with varrious F# (exclusive) techniques. Like;
- F# data; a package which allows at design time to interact with a data URL
- Patern matching; a way of handeling cases and checking for aspects of your data. 
- Async in F#; a bit harder then C# TAP but more expressive 

So the image fun is just modifing pixel data for hillarious effects. Up on today I only got a min and max of two images. But I try to come up with other ways of modifying images
